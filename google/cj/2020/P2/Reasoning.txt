- If a number 1 is followed by a number 2, definitely an unmatched open parenthesis "(" has to appear in an index between the 1 and the 2. 
- If a number 2 is followed by a number 1, definitely a matched closed parenthesis ")" has to appear in an index between the 2 and the 1. 


In general, we can follow this plan: 

# 1. We create the string before the first digit
- Create digit[0] open parenthesis '('

for i in range(len(digit)-1):
   k = digit[i+1] - digit[i]
   if k >= 0: 
      create k open parenthesis '('
   else:
      create k close parenthesis ')'

- Create digit[len(digit)-1] close parenthesis ')'
